## 0. Requirements

We use [nvidia-docker](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker#quick-start) for reliable GPU support in the containers. This is an extension to Docker and can be easily installed with just two commands. To run the networks, you need an nVidia GPU with >1GB of memory (at least Kepler).

## 1. Building the Docker image

Simply run `make`. This will create two Docker images: The OS base (an Ubuntu 18.04 base extended by nVidia, with CUDA 10.0 and CuDNN 7.3), and the "lmb-unet-server" image on top. In total, about **2.6GB** of space will be needed after building. This build will simply download the binary package from our project page, setup the environment to use it and when running the image start an SSH server that can be accessed via port 2222 of the docker host machine.

Alternatively you can run `make src` to build caffe_unet from source. The resulting image "lmb-unet-server-src" should work identical, but requires more space (about **6.7GB**). It is mainly intended to show you how caffe_unet can be built in a fresh Ubuntu installation.

## 2. Running containers

Run the `startServer.sh` script. It will ask you to set the password for `unetuser`. Then the ssh server is started and you get an interactive shell in the container and the server awaits U-Net jobs on port 2222. Closing the session also terminates the server.
